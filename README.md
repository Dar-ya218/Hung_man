## 🎭 Where Every Mistake Could Be Your Last... Literally!

Tired of boring hangman games? Welcome to the only game where the stick-man judges your every wrong letter!

## 🌟 Features That Will Make You (Try to) Think
- 🎯 Carefully selected words (and no, "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" isn't one of them!)
- 🎨 ASCII art that makes Paint feel proud
- 💭 Sarcastic messages included (free of charge!)
- 🎮 Interface so simple your grandma could play
- 🤔 A lives system that'll make you sweat

## 🚀 How to Play (or How to Fail with Style)
1. Open your terminal (yes, that scary black window)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```
3. Follow the instructions and pray you don't hang the stick-man!

## 💡 Pro Tips (that I know you'll ignore)
- Vowels exist (surprise!)
- 'Z' isn't in every word
- Random guessing isn't a strategy (but we all do it)
- The stick-man has no feelings (we hope)

## 🤓 Fun Facts

- Nobody has guessed "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" because I didn't put it in
- This README is longer than the actual game code
- There's a 99% chance you'll blame the game when you lose

## 🐛 "Special Features"
- May cause addiction
- Sarcastic messages might hurt your ego
- The stick-man might develop feelings (I'm working on it)
- Guaranteed to make you more popular at parties*

(*) Results may vary. I'm not responsible if nobody invites you to parties because you talk too much about this game.
